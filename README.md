This project focuses on advanced data analysis tasks using Pandas, including cleaning, transforming, and merging data. The Titanic dataset is used for hands-on practice.

Topics Covered

- Data Cleaning (Handling Missing Values, Removing Duplicates, Handling Outliers)
- Data Transformation & Normalization
- Merging and Concatenating DataFrames
- String Manipulation for Text Data Cleaning

Assignment Highlights
- Identify and handle missing values in the Titanic dataset
- Remove duplicate records and handle outliers in numerical columns
- Transform data types and create new features (e.g., FamilySize, FarePerPerson)
- Split, merge, and concatenate DataFrames based on different conditions
- Perform advanced analysis using groupby functions
- Extract text information using Pandas' string functions

Dataset
Titanic Dataset â€“ Contains passenger details such as age, class, fare, and survival status.

Results
- Cleaned and prepared the Titanic dataset for analysis
- Created new meaningful features for deeper insights
- Merged and concatenated datasets efficiently
- Performed group-based survival rate analysis
- Analyzed text-based data for further insights
